This Project aims to illustrate the basic concepts of SQL and can be utilized in either
day-to-day or in exigency situations. The following project is a Database
management system to store COVID-19 vaccination status made for a healthcare
centre and mobile pop-up vaccination clinics, which uses SQL concepts to keep a
check on the vaccination status of an individual who had taken a vaccine in either of
the mentioned centres. Based on the user groups, it has an administrator who
maintains the database, a vaccinator who can register and update the vaccination
status of an individual. And thereâ€™ll be subjects, who will be able to access and
retrieve their own vaccination status which can act as an assurance as a beneficiary
of the vaccination. It could act as a proof of vaccination which could be used as a
requirement to enter workplace facilities, colleges, public areas or to travel
internationally.
