This project is a database management system designed for a healthcare centre and mobile pop-up vaccination clinics to keep track of the COVID-19 vaccination status of individuals who have received the vaccine at either of the mentioned centres. The system uses SQL concepts to manage the data.

The system is designed for three user groups:

1. **Administrator**: The administrator maintains the database and has access to all the functionalities of the system.

2. **Vaccinator**: The vaccinator is responsible for registering and updating the vaccination status of an individual in the database.

3. **Subject**: The subject can access and retrieve their own vaccination status, which can be used as proof of vaccination for entering workplace facilities, colleges, public areas, or for traveling internationally.

The system provides basic functionalities such as registering a new individual, updating vaccination status, and retrieving vaccination status. The system can also generate reports based on various criteria.

The system is designed to be simple and easy to use, and can be utilized in both day-to-day and exigency situations. It can act as an assurance to the beneficiaries of the vaccination, as it provides a proof of vaccination which can be used as a requirement to enter various facilities or to travel internationally.
